										<h1>IT Technologies:</h1>
										<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>

									<h2>WHAT DOES IT DO?</h2>
									<p>Autonomous vehicle, also known as self-driving car, driverless car, or robo-car is a kind of vehicle that has newly appeared in recent years. It allows people to free their hands due to its ability to recognise the environment nearby and moves safely with little or even no human input. Autonomous cars combine a variety of technologies to perceive their surroundings, such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, odometry and inertial measurement units. And the sensory information combined by these technologies are used to work out a suitable path to go through by the advanced control system. There are several kinds of possible ways to apply this autonomous technology, which are connected vehicle platoons, personal self-driving vehicles, shared robotaxis and long-distance tracking. These projects to apply the autonomous technology are in various stages. “Waymo became the first service provider to offer robotaxi rides to the general public in Phoenix, Arizona in 2020, while Tesla has said it will offer subscription-based "full self-driving" to private vehicle owners in 2021, and Nuro has been allowed to start autonomous commercial delivery operations in California in 2021.” (Wikipedia contributors, Self-driving car, Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-driving_car&oldid=1019580320"><span>"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Self-driving_car&oldid=1019580320"</span></a>)</p>
									<p>Autonomous technologies of self-driving cars had been experimented since early 1920s, the test of performance, qualities and suitability was conducted since 1950s. Tsukuba Mechanical Engineering Laboratory in Japan built the first semi-automated car in 1977. The car has two cameras to gather information from the special marked streets and work out the path moving forward by the computer. The car can speed up to 30km/h supported by railway.</p>
									<p>To follow up how the autonomous technology is going on in recent years, a Guinness World record was set by the Robocar as the fastest self-driving car in the world in 2019, which reached a speed of 282.42km/h. The nearest progress of self-driving car was made by Honda, a Japanese company. Their product Legend Hybrid EX cars are approved by Japanese government to be Level 3 automated driving equipment which is granted the safety certification. Their “Traffic Jam Pilot” technology, which allows drivers to take their eyes off the road legally  has been attached to their autonomous sedans. For now, the leaders of autonomous vehicles have already reached a level 4 technology, but there will be lots of limits such as good weather and it has to be daytime. For this reason, level 4 technology is not used widely by the companies. The most advanced self-driving cars that can be bought in the market are still driven by level 3 technology. Cadillac’s Super Cruise system seems to be the most widely recognized leader in level 3 self-driving technology. The system can be used on highways which are pre-mapped, and it is the only hands-free system which is available to the public.</p>
									<p>To draw a blueprint for the autonomous vehicles three years in the future, autonomous technology will be firmly continuing its development. But it might be difficult for the vehicle automation to reach a level 5 in three years. A level 5 technology means the vehicle will be full automation with the advanced ADS system and can achieve all the functions by itself whatever the condition is. Two key technologies that limit the development of self-driving technology are ADAS(Advanced Driver Assistance System) and AIS(Automotive Information System). Though there are lots of competitors in this field, which makes these two key technologies develop quickly, it still takes some time to carry out all the technologies that are required by a level 5 vehicle automation. Hopefully, we will see level 5 autonomous vehicles soon in the future.</p>

									<h2>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</h2>
									<p>There are lots of impacts in many different fields that are brought by the autonomous technology. Firstly, the development of autonomous vehicles is likely to cause unemployment of professional drivers. There are lots of people take driving as a job, and once self-driving cars come out, those people may lose their jobs as taxi or truck drivers. On the contrary, there might be a extremely increase of market of autonomous vehicles. A self-driving car which is proved to be safe will bring much convenience to the consumers. People do not need to keep focusing on driving any more, which is a big advantage that lots of the people would like to take. Due to all this advantages, autonomous vehicles will take a large part of the vehicle market. And there will be lots of relational jobs appearing, such as autonomous program developer, autonomous vehicle repairman and autonomous chip maker. As a side industry of Auto industry, the auto insurance industry may also increase. With a normal car, drivers are going to take the responsibility in a traffic accident. But when there are all autonomous vehicles in a traffic accident, who is going to take the responsibility then? At this time, an insurance company might be involved. What is more, autonomous vehicles may also reduce the rate of traffic accident. Lots of traffic accidents are due to fatigue driving and the bad decisions that are made by the drivers. But when it comes to be a self-driving vehicle, that is not even a problem at all.</p>

									<h2>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</h2>
									<p>When it comes to the impact to individuals, autonomous vehicles might make big differences to peoples’ daily lives. First of all, a autonomous car owner can finish their trip in a much more easier way than a normal car driver, especially when traveling long distances. People can enjoy their trip more with their hands free and eyes no more staring at the way forward. People can have more time to spend with their families or friends even it is in a car. Another advantage for individual is that the autonomous vehicles owners do not need to remember the route clearly, because the vehicles are going find the way themselves with the help of GPS. This makes it easier when people are driving through a unfamiliar place. Personally, I look good upon the development of autonomous vehicles. One of the reasons is the convenience autonomous vehicles can bring to my life. Another reason is I trust machines more than people, machines will only do what they are set to do, but people always make bad decisions. Due to this reason, I believe my life will be safer with the autonomous vehicles.</p>
