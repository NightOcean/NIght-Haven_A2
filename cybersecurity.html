									<h2>WHAT DOES IT DO?</h2>
									<p>Cyber security is the defence for computers, networks, data, electronic systems, servers, and mobile devices to protect them from attacks. It is also called electronic information security or information technology security. Cyber security can be divided into several different categories. Network security is a method to protect computer network from the attack of malwares or cyber attackers. Application security is to keep software and devices safe from all kinds of threats, once it fails, the protected data of applications might be accessible to the attackers. Information security is to promise the safety and privacy of the data when they are being stored or transferred. Operational security is to protect the personal data while users are premising to access a network, storing or sharing their data. Disaster recovery and business continuity are the abilities to help recover the lost data. Disaster recovery is a security for the data that are deleted by mistake or recovery the data in other data loss occasions. Business continuity promises the continuity of business while there are not enough resources. End-user education’s purpose is to teach people how to keep a good cyber security. Looking into the future, cyber security technology will continue to be improved. It might be hard to make predictions to what it is going to be like 3 years in the future. But it seems to be a firmly truth that users’ End-user responsibility will rise. The popularity and development of the internet decides that people will be more used to cyber security</p>

									<h2>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</h2>
									<p>The rise of cyber security means a lot to the market, especially in the high-tech field. When users are using computers or smart phones, cyber security is the very important part that they need to consider. Most of the people do not want their data to be shared with someone unknown or lose easily. And the more need the users have, the bigger market it will be. The need of cyber security creates many new jobs that are associated with this, such as security specialist, incident responder, security administrator, cryptographer, Etc. All these new jobs appeared with cyber security enlarged the employment market, more and more people are choosing this field and benefit from it. It is a positive impact to the society. There are new jobs created, but hardly any jobs disappeared. Cyber security is a by-product of network development. It appears with the development of network, so this is hardly any jobs are major in this field. But more and more jobs are created.</p>

									<h2>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</h2>
									<p>Technology is playing a more and more important role in people’s lives. There is no doubt that technologies bring much convenience to people’s lives, but it also brings some potential security problems. One of the most common ones is cyber security problems. These security problems can cause a situation of information leakage or loss or blocking of devices’ operation. These situations caused by the cyber security problems can be very annoying to people, sometimes they even become threats. But the appearance of cyber security makes these network safety problems happen less than before. In other words, cyber security gives people the power to fight against all kinds of network attacks. It improves the safety of the net environment of the users. </p>
