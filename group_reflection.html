									<h2>Kelvin Tran</h2>
									<h3>1. What went well?</h3>
									<p>Everyone had a good start of understanding their topic/task and are able to form a base structure for their respective area of work.</p>
									<h3>2. What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>What needs to be improved is that I need to be more direct and answer concerns for the group members if they have issues.</p>
									<h3>3. At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>Sometimes I just find my group members disappear without notice.</p>
									<h3>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>
									<p>What I’ve learned about being in this group, is that there is a need to know each other’s strengths and weakness to improve their work ethics.</p>
									<p>For the GitHub itself, there is not much audit trail commit as everyone just gave personal feedbacks rather than handle the request/pulls themselves.</p>

									<h2>Jiyuan Wu (Bruce)</h2>
									<h3>1. What went well?</h3>
									<p>Everyone is doing well with their part of work and I am glad to see us as a whole group who can help each other.</p>
									<h3>2. What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>Some of the decisions were made hastily, especially when assigning work. Maybe everyone in the group should read the instructions of the assignment carefully next time, this helps the work then easier.</p>
									<h3>3. At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>I am surprised by the fantasy work that has been done by my group, we started a little bit late than others. But things are turning out to be fine at the end.</p>
									<h3>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>
									<p>A group is a group, not just 6 individuals. I'd like to see the cohesion of my group with everyone involved.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Qiurui Xu (Richard)</h2>
									<h3>1. What went well?</h3>
									<p>We are all very efficient learners, and we finish our assigned tasks early to have a good pace. When differences of opinion arise, we also resolve them through communication and voting.</p>
									<h3>2. What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>I need to improve my presentation skills, and my group members often misunderstand me because of my inarticulate speech.</p>
									<h3>3. At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>I was surprised at how efficient my group was in communicating. When someone is in trouble, others are always eager and prompt to help and answer questions.</p>
									<h3>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>
									<p>I learned from the group to listen to other people's perspectives. Their ideas then influence my thinking and broaden my horizons. Group members are not only studying partners. They are also your teachers.</p>

									<h2>Yicheng Lu (Dave)</h2>
									<h3>1. What went well?</h3>
									<p>The team worked well during meetings.</p>
									<h3>2. What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>I think we could improve in the document sharing.</p>
									<h3>3. At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>Everything even small made a good contribution to our project and have a great organization for the meeting each time.</p>
									<h3>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>
									<p>A detailed plan is important at the beginning to show a path of how it led our group to complete our work.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2></h2>
									<h3>1. What went well?</h3>
									<p>Everyone contributed and done a part of their work.</p>
									<h3>2. What could be improved?</h3>
									<p>More communication and setting deadlines so work isn't procrastinated.</p>
									<h3>3. At least one thing that was surprising?</h3>
									<p>The project idea, it seems difficult but fun to make. So, I’m willing to invest time to create a working prototype next assignment.</p>
									<h3>4. At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>
									<p>Everyone needs to take responsibility for their part and complete the work.</p>
