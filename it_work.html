										<h1>IT Work</h1>
									</header>

									<p>Over the course of this assignment, we conducted an interview where one of our group members, Kemar, sent a public post on reddit if anyone with an IT Job was interested in participating in an interview and was successful in receiving a response. We also used an RMIT Consent Form to inform the user their rights in participating this interview.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>1. Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do?</h2>
									<p>Currently I am an IT manager for the US branch of a German manufacturing company. Currently there is only 1 other person in the IT department, but we are hiring more people. Currently I manage every aspect of IT at this branch and the branches in Canada and Mexico. System administration, networking, security and helpdesk. We are hiring a helpdesk and system administrator so I can juggle less things and do more innovation of our IT platforms.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>2. Please tell us about the industry you work in.</h2>
									<p>In my current role as with most of my roles I wear much more than one hat. Developing new systems or using IT to make the end users life easier is generally my main task and the one I like the most. While I don’t mind helping people generally I prefer to land on the networking, security and system engineer side of things than helpdesk. Currently I am replacing our entire server and network infrastructure to be faster, more secure and have better visibility. I am using Cisco Hyperflex and Cisco Meraki to attain this and more easily manage our systems to free up my time more to deal with other things.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>3. What other kinds of work do you have to do?</h2>
									<p>I currently juggle quite a lot. I am studying at Georgia Tech for my masters in artificial intelligence and run my own side business with a few friends where I do penetration testing and security training for medium to small businesses.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them.</h2>
									<p>In IT you kind of deal a bit with everyone. In every role I have had I know everybody up and down the ladder from the front line workers to the CEO. In this role it is no different, especially because I need to fight for budgets and other things now for my department.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals.</h2>
									<p>I have lots of interactions with other professionals. At work I am only one man so we often contract out parts of projects to IT businesses that offer niche services. These skilled people are some I work with constantly to lighten my workload. I also interact with many of the top minds at school and work in the AI field.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>6. What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h2>
									<p>I rarely see the clients unless it’s my own business. A few minutes when someone can’t get to the WiFi or something. Same for investors.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>7. What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these.</h2>
									<p>The most time is spent on the people who just refuse to or can’t learn simple things. Turning on their wireless keyboard. Turning on their printer. Turning on their monitor and other super dumb things. You might think no way it’s that much. It’s rather depressing how dumb many people are sometimes. Devising ways to make sure these dumb people don’t take up too much of my time is my number one time sink.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h2>
									<p>The constant changes in technology and the way things are done. I work a large part in security as well as the others and it moves so fast. Keeping up is hard. Hack the box is one of my best tools for keeping up to date and skills sharp.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?</h2>
									<P>One time , I was given $10,000 and 6 months to make an entire new domain and tons of new processes between a global windows network and 1 all Mac site. This I feel was the essence of IT. Never enough time or money to do every task really well. Sure you can get it done but it bothers me to not do a good job to my standards. With time and money constraints it becomes very hard to show the value of IT to management.</P>
