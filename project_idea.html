										<h1>Project Name: Soul Companion</h1>
									</header>

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>The project “Soul Companion”, a game that focuses on the puzzle and exploration concept set in a world after an apocalypse that involves interactions between the user and the player.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Motivation</h2>
									<p>As a group, we all enjoy playing games one way or another and that this could be a learning experience as to how game developers make games interesting to the eyes of the players. As an IT perspective this can lead to working as a team where one’s individual idea could sparks other people’s interests or passions.</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Description</h2>
									<p>The project “Soul Companion” is a game that will be made using GameMaker and would be operated on Windows OS as a .exe file.</p>
									<p>The main concept or objective of the game is to control the player to “Create Interaction and Explore”. Interaction can mean anything from being influence by your environment or surroundings and likewise, taking the action to influence others around you. Explore in my words can be taken as two ways, one is travelling, and the other is learning new ways to adapt or complete an objective in a new possible way.</p>
									<p>The user will be thrown into a mysterious world after an unknown entity has cause the world’s demise, however this world is rapidly evolving beyond what its original natural habitat or environment used to be capable of. You start off with controlling a silent player that would later start to interact with its environment and surroundings.</p>
									<p>The user will be given no plot directions outside of just instructions on how to play the game. The game will simply, or more specifically the player will tell you that they will unconsciously want to interact more with you and the objects or people around them. If there is a main focus, then it would be that you, the user must help the player survive.</p>
									<p>There will be action or special commands that the user can ask the player to do or respond, such as interacting with objects or people.</p>
									<p>Action commands can be like interact, accept, decline, and will depend on the situation you are in the game.</p>
									<p>An example of a special command is that you can ask the player how they are feeling right now, or to dance to the background music that only you can hear.</p>
									<p>In terms of background music or audio, I am hoping we can create something that lean towards ambience music with a mix of fantasy or another genre while also reminding the user (you) or the player that this is a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
									<p>As this is a game that is set in a post-apocalyptic world that changes it’s environment, every area’s design will be different to its predecessor and will contribute to the game having a more exploration theme. An example can be an abandoned city where it is still running due to being affected by its changing environment.</p>
									<p>In this game, there is no such thing as game overs. So, when you come across a difficult situation, the player will prompt the user to just retry into they complete it. However, there will be situations where your choices are permanent, and you will never be able to go back again unless you start from the very beginning. These choices will not really cause a grave error on your end and will not affect your overall experience with the player.</p>
									<p>While the target audience is for anybody who enjoy games in general, it is aimed towards those who enjoy solving puzzles and wanting to explore new areas while creating your own story that would test the bonds between the user and the player. You will also enjoy this game if you like to interact with the player and help them solve their problem.</p>
									<p>I like to mention that there is actually no story given but more like you imagine your own story which is the journey you have with the player as you travel from place to place.</p>

									<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
									<p>The software, hardware, and equipment the project would need are:</p>
									<p> - The program I would use to make the game would be GameMaker as it is quite beginner friendly. (Other options could be Open RPG Maker, Clickteam Fusion or Unity)<br>
										- While most of the components can be made in GameMaker, we would also need a music production software that can create sound effects and music such as some few free recommendations are:</p>
									<li>LMMS - <a href="https://lmms.io/" class="label">https://lmms.io/</span></a></li>
									<li>Bfxr - <a href="https://www.bfxr.net/" class="label">https://www.bfxr.net/</span></a></li>
									<li>Famitracker <a href="http://famitracker.com/" class="label">http://famitracker.com/</span></a></li><br>
									<p>- Some good viable pixel art software:</p>
									<li>Krita - <a href="https://krita.org/en" class="label">https://krita.org/en/</span></a></li>
									<li>Gimp - <a href="https://www.gimp.org" class="label">https://www.gimp.org/</span></a></li>
									<li>GraphicsGale - <a href="https://graphicsgale.com/us" class="label">https://graphicsgale.com/us</span></a></li>
									<p>A computer setup is essential for this as all the creation is done on computer. There are many ways to create this game and there are no problems with converting files to the appropriate files as there are converting tools online.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h2>Skills Required</h2>
									<P>For the project, Soul Companion to run and execute as a game I intend it to be, would need the following:<br>
										For myself (Kelvin Tran)<br>
										- Revisit and improve my skills in using the GameMaker Language. <br>
										- OR possibly learn other source game engine (Unity, Godot, etc) <br>
										For everyone and I: <br> 
										- Have a strong and unique creative mind. <br>
										- Be in the shoes of the users playing the game. <br>
										- Able to work as part of a team <br>
										- Communication skills <br>
										- Commitment to understanding and using new technology <br>
									<p>These can all be achievable by simply just having a strong passion to make or play games while also being innovative.</p>
									<hr class="major" />
									<h3>Outcome</h3>
									<P>If this game is completed, or a prototype version featuring the interactions made by you (The user) and the player throughout the game, the end results would show that you have a connection with the player, no matter how it turns out. Because this is a game, the users would normally follow instructions on how to play the game and progress through, however my intentions are that I want the users to find out by themselves by connecting with the player that they are controlling, and that they will share a bond that only they would know of. The impact of this development is that the user would empathise with the player by helping them, and in return will make the user feel satisfied.</P>
