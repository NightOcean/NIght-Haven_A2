									<h1>IT Technologies:</h1>
									<h2>Robots</h2>

								<h2>WHAT DOES IT DO?</h2>
								<p>A robot is a kind of machine that is able to complete a series of actions automatically. People have to program manually by a computer and inset the program into the robot, so that the robot can complete the tasks which are set in the program. Robot can be controlled by an external terminal or follow the program that is set inside. Some of the robots are built as human form due to some special outlook requirements, but most of them are built like machines to work more effectively. Nowadays the robots are used mainly to do some repeated work which are boring or dangerous, some work that require to focus on it for a long period or some work that need to operate more accurately than a normal human can be. There are several different kinds of robots: pre-programmed robots, humanoid robots, autonomous robots, teleoperated robots and augmenting robots.</p><hr class="major" />
								<p>Pre-programmed robots are set to do some simple and repeated work in a controlled environment, they are now widely used in manufacturing. They will only do what is set in their program and repeat their tasks. Compared to human, this kind of robot is more efficient because they never feel tired and they never need to spend time eating or sleeping, and they never get bored. Humanoid robots are robots who have human looks or behave like a human. This kind of robot can deal with people, people will feel more comfortable to cooperate with a thing with human look or human behaviours rather than a cold machine. Autonomous robots are able to operate independently without any help from human, usually they are working in open environments to carry out their tasks.</p>
								<p>Sweeping robot is a good example of autonomous robots, they move around the place to find anything like dirt or rubbish and then clean them up. Teleoperated robots are semi-autonomous robots that are controlled by human remotely, they are used in some special environment that normal human cannot reach. When scientists need to explore deep under the sea, they may think about using a teleoperated robot.
								<p>Augmenting robots help people through strengthening the abilities they already have or replace the lost abilities; they can act as artificial limbs to allow people have more power to do the things they cannot do before. All these kinds of robots involve in many different fields in peoples’ lives, such as manufacturing, logistics, travel, home uses and healthcare.</p>	
								<p>Various advanced technologies are developing fast in recent years, all these technologies contribute to the development of advanced fields like robot. There is no doubt that there will be a big progress being made in robot field. The government of Japan hopes to commercial service robots in 2025. There are many advanced robots science research led by Japanese government. With the support of the government, Japanese service robot industries may make a big change to the market soon in the future. Hopefully, we will see some robots instead of human staffs more often in the shops or workforce in 3 years.</p>
								<h2>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</h2>
								<p>There are lots of impacts in many different fields that are brought by the autonomous technology. Firstly, the development of autonomous vehicles is likely to cause unemployment of professional drivers. There are lots of people take driving as a job, and once self-driving cars come out, those people may lose their jobs as taxi or truck drivers. On the contrary, there might be a extremely increase of market of autonomous vehicles. A self-driving car which is proved to be safe will bring much convenience to the consumers. People do not need to keep focusing on driving any more, which is a big advantage that lots of the people would like to take. Due to all this advantages, autonomous vehicles will take a large part of the vehicle market. And there will be lots of relational jobs appearing, such as autonomous program developer, autonomous vehicle repairman and autonomous chip maker. As a side industry of Auto industry, the auto insurance industry may also increase. With a normal car, drivers are going to take the responsibility in a traffic accident. But when there are all autonomous vehicles in a traffic accident, who is going to take the responsibility then? At this time, an insurance company might be involved. What is more, autonomous vehicles may also reduce the rate of traffic accident. Lots of traffic accidents are due to fatigue driving and the bad decisions that are made by the drivers. But when it comes to be a self-driving vehicle, that is not even a problem at all.</p>

								<h2>WHAT IS THE LIKELY IMPACT?</h2>
								<p>Due to the extreme increase in the robot’s field, the employment market may be turbulent, especially in the manufacturing industry and service industry. The number of manufacturing robots were almost a double of the human workers. And we can see that the number of robots that are used in the manufacturing field will keep increasing in the coming few years due to the advantages comparing to normal human workers. The development of robot industries seems not to be good news for young workers or low-educated workers in the manufacturing industry. But on the other side, the development of robot industry also provides some new jobs to the high-educated group. With the raising of robot industry, some relational industries may also benefit from this. There will be a increasing need of high level researchers to explore new fields of robots to help produce some more advanced robots. Also, there will be an increasing need of materials for building robots and the robot maintenance staffs. For the service industries, the employment rate will also decrease due to the rise of service robots. Service robots are much less than human employees right now as people always see human staffs when they go to shops or restaurants. But in nowadays rapid development of science and technology, things are changing rapidly. It seems to be a firm truth that more robots will be involved in service industry, and it is also true that the job market is going to have a huge change due to the increasing number of robots that are being used in the general market. Some of the jobs may disappear, and some other new jobs are coming up to people.</p>

								<h2>HOW WILL THIS AFFECT YOU?</h2>
								<p>For the influences of the robots to individuals, there is no doubt that people’s lives will be more automated and convenient than before. Now we can find many different robots are involved in many parts of our lives. In the healthcare field, we have robots to help deal with the patients who have disabilities such as Robear, which is a kind of robot bear that can help lift the patients into wheelchairs from their beds. Some other robots also involve in surgeries that require accuracy out of normal humans’ capability. Doctors may use surgical robots to perform delicate operations, this helps improve the success rate of surgeries. In service industry, humanoid robots can be seen easily in some Morden shops. They take the part of waiters or waitresses to help meet the needs of customers, they usually involve in the work like food serving, orders taking and doing some simple communication with customers. Also, there are many kinds of useful home robots to help people with their housework. The most representative one is the sweeping robot. They help sweeping the floor at home automatically and they are small enough to reach some place that may be hard to reach by human and clean them up. There are also robots for amusement. For example, the music robots. They are able to play some specific instruments to amuse people. Compared to traditional bands, a band of robots never make a mistake in playing. Similarly, there are dancing robots as well. Their job is to amuse people as well as the music robots. If paying attention, people will find many robots in their lives. All these robots are affecting people’s lives in a positive way. They make people’s lives easier and much more fun than before. And their participation in some fields makes things are hard to come true come true. Looking forward to the future, it will be a better world with the robots.</p>
